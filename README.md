# VECM
VECM (Vector Error Correction Model) is a limited VAR (Vector Autoregressive) model that is used for non-stationary but cointegrated variables, this model is included in multivariate time series analysis. This model can also be used to determine causal relationships. 
The following are the VECM analysis steps:
1 Stationarity test, using ADF Test (Augmented Dickey Fuller)
2 Johansen Cointegration Test, see how many equations are formed
3 Model fit test
4 Information criteria for selecting order lag p using AIC (Akaike Information Criteria)
5 Causality Analysis, aims to see the causal relationship between variables
6 Forecasting
